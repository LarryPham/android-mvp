\section{Research}

\IEEEPARstart{B}{efore} the application prototype is built, composing components of \emph{Android} applications are introduced in this chapter. In addition, it is shown why the MVP approach may improve app development and what MVP actually is.
% MVP applied to Android Apps

\subsection{Concepts \& Components of Android Applications}
Building \emph{Android} applications requires several core components of the \emph{Android} SDK to be used. This section gives a short overview and explanation of important components used in the implementation of the prototype created for this paper.

\textbf{Activity}: An application typically consists of one or more activities. An activity fills the whole screen of the device and can be compared to a \emph{window} in a classic desktop application. The official \emph{Android} SDK documentation \cite{SDKActivities} defines an activity as \enquote{an application component that provides a screen with which users can interact in order to do something}.
There is a defined lifcycle, which all activity objects share and follow -- the creation, start, resume, pause, stop and the destruction of an activity object. This lifecycle is managed by \emph{Android} itself, meaning application developers must not manually create or destroy activity objects.

\textbf{Fragment}: Fragments split more complex parts of an activity's user interface into several smaller sub-components. Fragments are also used to encapsulate reusable parts of the user interface, which for example need to appear in multiple activities. The official documentation of the \emph{Android} SDK defines a fragment as follows \cite{SDKFragments}:

\begin{quote}
A Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an Activity. You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI and reuse a fragment in multiple activities.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Intent}: Intents are objects used for communication with the \emph{Android} system. An example would be the start of an activity: an intent must be created including some information to identify, which activity should be started. The intent will be handed over to the \emph{Android} system, which will create and start a corresponding activity. In the official SDK documentation, an intent is defined as \enquote{a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component} \cite{SDKIntents}.

\subsection{Common Android Development Approach}
As a result of strong interrelations between its building components, the \emph{Android} system manages most of its components by itself. Given the complexity and interaction between these as well as the general structure, the framework steers developers toward handling tasks in common ways. In order to help developers understand the structure of the framework, code examples and component explanations are provided in \cite{SDKComponents}.

Since the building components are managed by the system and dependent on the implementations, one aspect that is inherently difficult is \emph{testability}. It is a challenge to divide business logic from the framework as it needs to react to certain system events -- like activity destruction, which may be forced by the system at any point in time and need to be appropriately handled by the developer.

Other common difficulties developers face lie with the \emph{maintainability} and \emph{extensibility} of their software. Given the \emph{Android} framework, its many components and classes that enable communication between these components, the structure often gets cluttered -- especially in larger application projects. For example, \emph{ListView}s\footnote{Component to \enquote{display a list of scrollable items} \cite{SDKListView}.} need \emph{Adapter}\footnote{Class to \enquote{bridge between AdapterView and the underlying data} \cite{SDKAdapter}.} to display their content, which in turn might use \emph{Loader}s\footnote{Component that \enquote{performs asynchronous loading of data} \cite{SDKLoader}.} and \emph{Cursor}s\footnote{Interface class providing access to results of database queries \cite{SDKCursor}.} to fetch the data to display.

In addition \emph{portability} is a problem as business logic that is strongly intertwined when developing for the \emph{Android} platform cannot easily be ported to other platforms.


\subsection{MVP: Passive View or Supervising Controller?}

Today, when we talk about MVP, we are talking about two different types: \emph{Supervising Controller} \cite{FowlerSupervisingController} and \emph{Passive View} \cite{FowlerPassiveView}. Fowler retired the classic MVP approach in 2006 \cite{FowlerMvpRetirementNote} and introduced those two implementations -- see Figure \ref{fig:mvp}.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{mvp}
\caption{Supervising Controller and Passive View}
\label{fig:mvp}
\end{figure}

The \textbf{Supervising Controller} approach splits the User Interface in two components: a \emph{Presenter} and \emph{View} â€“ like the classical MVP approach. The \emph{Model} can communicate changes to the \emph{View} using an Observer pattern (indirectly shown as dotted lines in Figure \ref{fig:mvp}). The \emph{View} can make direct changes to the model. In most cases this is done by simple mappings and \emph{Data Binding} capabilities provided by UI frameworks. Any user input is handled by the \emph{Presenter}. It determines how those interactions affect the underlying \emph{Model}. In addition, it handles complex view logic operations i.e. to prepare the model data for the view layer or vice versa, to transform the user input to fit the model requirements.

In contrast to the Supervising Controller, the \textbf{Passive View} totally separates the \emph{View} from the \emph{Model}. There is no direct or indirect interaction between them -- see Figure \ref{fig:mvp}. Interactions between \emph{View} and \emph{Model} is done exclusively via the \emph{Presenter}. This approach reduces the \emph{View} to an absolute minimum by using the \emph{Presenter} to handle all user input events, to update the \emph{Model} based on user interactions as well as to channel \emph{Model} changes back to the \emph{View}. As a result, the \emph{View} is made completely passive and is no longer responsible for updating itself from the \emph{Model}.

The primary driver for \emph{Passive View} is testing. This concept allows testing to be focused on the \emph{Presenter} without needing any interaction with the chosen UI framework.
