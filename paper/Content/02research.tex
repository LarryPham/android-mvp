\section{MVP applied to Android Apps}

\IEEEPARstart{I}{n} this chapter, the questions are answered by research. Blablablabalabalaba.


Before we elaborate how we applied the MVP approach to our prototype

In the next section we show in detail how we applied that shit


\subsection{Components of an \emph{Android} Application}

Building an \emph{Android} application requires several core components of the \emph{Android} SDK to be used. This section gives a short overview and short explanation of the components, used for the prototype, created for this paper.

\textbf{Activity}: An application typically consists of one or more activities. An activity fills the whole screen of the device and can be compared to a \emph{window} in a classic desktop application. The official \emph{Android} SDK documentation \cite{SDKActivities} defines an activity as \enquote{an application component that provides a screen with which users can interact in order to do something}.
There is a defined lifcycle, which all activity objects go through -- the creation, start, stop and the destruction of an activity object. This lifecycle is managed by \emph{Android} itself, meaning an application developer must not manually create or destroy activity objects.

\textbf{Fragment}: Fragments split more complex parts of an activity's user interface into several smaller sub-components. Fragments are also used to encapsulate reusable parts of the user interface, which for example need to appear in multiple activities. The official documentation of the \emph{Android} SDK defines a fragment as follows \cite{SDKFragments}:

\begin{quote}
A Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an Activity. You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI and reuse a fragment in multiple activities.
\end{quote}

\subsection{MVP: Passive View or Supervising Controller?}

Today, when we talk about MVP, we are talking about two different types: \emph{Supervising Controller} \cite{FowlerSupervisingController} and \emph{Passive View} \cite{FowlerPassiveView}. Fowler retired the classic MVP approach in 2006 \cite{FowlerMvpRetirementNote} and introduced those two implementations -- see Figure \ref{fig:mvp}.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{mvp}
\caption{Supervising Controller and Passive View}
\label{fig:mvp}
\end{figure}

The \textbf{Supervising Controller} approach splits the User Interface in two components: a \emph{Presenter} and \emph{View} â€“ like the classical MVP approach. The \emph{Model} can communicate changes to the \emph{View} using an Observer pattern (indirectly shown as dotted lines in Figure \ref{fig:mvp}). The \emph{View} can make direct changes to the model. In most cases this is done by simple mappings and \emph{Data Binding} capabilities provided by UI frameworks. Any user input is handled by the \emph{Presenter}. It determines how those interactions affect the underlying \emph{Model}. In addition, it handles complex view logic operations i.e. to prepare the model data for the view layer or vice versa, to transform the user input to fit the model requirements.

In contrast to the Supervising Controller, the \textbf{Passive View} totally separates the \emph{View} from the \emph{Model}. There is no direct or indirect interaction between them -- see Figure \ref{fig:mvp}. Interactions between \emph{View} and \emph{Model} is done exclusively via the \emph{Presenter}. This approach reduces the \emph{View} to an absolute minimum by using the \emph{Presenter} to handle all user input events, to update the \emph{Model} based on user interactions as well as to channel \emph{Model} changes back to the \emph{View}. As a result, the \emph{View} is made completely passive and is no longer responsible for updating itself from the \emph{Model}.

The primary driver for \emph{Passive View} is testing. This concept allows testing to be focused on the \emph{Presenter} without needing any interaction with the chosen UI framework.
